I decided to study software engineering because I love the incredible amount of possibilities within the tech field and coding languages themselves. Computers are incredible devices that since their inception has taken humanity into the literal stratosphere and beyond. The best part is we’re only starting to scratch the surface of what they are capable of. There’s so much growth and potential in the field that I can’t wait to be a part of it.  Coding in a way for me is like playing one of my favorite strategy games. There’s almost always a way to achieve your objective its just a matter of being resourceful enough to figure out how. That feeling of accomplishment when you finally get something to run is addictive and ultimately what drives me forward.

You can spend hours debugging because of one tiny little error, but when you finally figure it out and fix it it’s such a release. As frustrating as languages can be it’s almost always human error and thus forces you to constantly fix your own mistakes. Not only fix them, but learn to prevent them. Writing code is like writing another page of yourself. Your knowledge grows as your programs grow. As they become more robust and built to scale, so do you. If they are too rigid and don’t age well then one might find the same about you. Software like any creation is a reflection of the creator. 
Software development challenges me, intrigues me, and forces me to be better. I could hardly ask for more from a career. The job opportunities and pay are icing on an already delicious cake though.
