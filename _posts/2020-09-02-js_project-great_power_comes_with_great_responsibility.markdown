Javascript was a considerable departure from Ruby. It's syntax took some getting used to and the prototypal design of pre ES6. It was very much a language born of a different era that has been forced to adapt and grow with changing times. However the functionality it provides is rather useful. From event listeners to the asynchronous calls allow for a much more dynamic user experience. Less constant refreshing and more user engagement that ultimately creates a satisfying webapp.  


When designing my project I did run into some issues with AJAX in terms of one asynchronous call. One function required data from another, but was finishing significantly earlier than the other. Unlike Ruby where everything fires off in sequence unless told otherwise, it took a bit of tinkering to find a process that worked. That being said once it was working it became clear the benefits provided by AJAX.

When connecting a rails backend to the javascript frontend it was a bit daunting at first, but made sense after a bit. Separation of concerns was hammered in early by Flatiron and that really helped here. Otherwise it would become easy to get lost in all the moving interconnected parts needed to bring this to life.

Now moving forward into REACT, Iâ€™m interested to see what new tools it provides me. The joy of this program has been the sheer amount of skills learned in a relatively short time. 4 months ago I had no clue about AJAX, MVC, OO, and all the standard design principles or techniques that help shape the web. So much to learn and so little time as it were.
