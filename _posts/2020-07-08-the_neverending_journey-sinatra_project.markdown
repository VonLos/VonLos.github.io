I remember our cohort lead, Jenn Hansen, mentioning in the early days that Sinatra was when a lot of people started to feel like proper web developers. After finishing this project I'm rather inclined to agree. It was challenging, but very enlightening. By combining my CLI  application's use of an API and building a website to persist data pulled from it, what I've created is a simplified version of the MAL website. The website the Jikan API I use actually pulls data from. 

MAL is a website that acts as a both of database for all things anime and a resource for viewers to create their own lists. In other words the perfect site to base a sinatra project off of as that translates very nicely to MVC format. There was a bit of difficulty with active record, but ultimately my project allows users to search up a variety of information regarding any anime that is in the mal site itself and persist it as their own personal list. 

Later I plan on hosting it via Heroku to proudly display it. Afterall, why put so much effort into something and not show it off just a bit. Though the main thing this project showed me was just how far I have to go. I'm starting to feel somewhat skilled and confident, but there is so much more to learn and develop that it's mind boggling. This journey may carry me for the rest of my days and that's an oddly satisfying notion.
